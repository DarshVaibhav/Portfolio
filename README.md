# Darsh Vaibhav - Portfolio
## About
Hi, I'm Darsh Vaibhav! Currently I am a 4th year B.Tech(Computer Science and Engineering) with a profound interest in Data Analyst, Data Science and Machine Learning. I am also a strong problem-solver with the ability to derive valuable insights from datasets. I am excited to bring my technical and analytical skills to the field of data science.

I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques, and I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. Whether working on a team or independently, I am driven by the thrill of discovering new insights from data to solve complex problems.

This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics / Data Science related topics.

## Experience
Data Science Intern at YBI Foundation

**Description:** The project focused on analyzing a dataset of movies released between 1980 ad 2022. The dataset included movie titles, ratings, genres, release dates, budgets, gross earnings, and other relevant information. The project involved loading the data, cleaning and preprocessing it, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), analyzing the correlation between budget and gross earnings, and implemented Pearson’s correlation statistical analysis.

**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, correlation matrices, hypothesis testing, data visualization.

**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, SciPy.

**Results:** Using Python functions the analysis revealed that votes and budget have the highest correlation with gross earnings, while the company has no significant correlation.

**Internship Certificate:** ['Internship Certificate'](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_6HOQRMBjOc001WbBwKG1l_mrlxICnEh/view?usp=drive_link)
